Reflect: Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  We need to use a remote repository when we want to collaborate with others. We can share our code via a remote repository.

Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If Git would automatically push my changes to remote it might happen that it pushed things that are not ready to be shared with others, or incomplete.
